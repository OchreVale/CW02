        <h2 id = oedipus>Oedipus</h2>
        <p class = first_parangraph >
            Oedipus, in Greek mythology, the king of Thebes who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother.
             Homer related that Oedipus’s wife and mother hanged herself when the truth of their relationship became known,
              though Oedipus apparently continued to rule at Thebes until his death. In the post-Homeric tradition,
               most familiar from Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex (or Oedipus the King) and Oedipus at Colonus, 
               there are notable differences in emphasis and detail.
        </p>
        <p class=nd_paragraph>According to one version of the story, Laius, king of Thebes,
             was warned by an oracle that his son would slay him. Accordingly,
              when his wife, Jocasta (Iocaste; in Homer, Epicaste), bore a son, 
              he had the baby exposed (a form of infanticide) on Cithaeron.
               (Tradition has it that his name, which means “Swollen-Foot,”
                was a result of his feet having been pinned together, 
                but modern scholars are skeptical of that etymology.) 
                A shepherd took pity on the infant, 
                who was adopted by King Polybus of Corinth and his wife and was brought up as their son.
                 In early manhood Oedipus visited Delphi and upon learning that
                  he was fated to kill his father and marry his mother,
             he resolved never to return to Corinth.</p>
             <h2 id = "barca">FC Barcelona </h2>
             <p class=rd_paragraph>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,
              the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism,
               hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). 
               Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona.
                It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion,
                 and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue,
                  with an annual turnover of €715.1 million.[2][3]
                   The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", 
                   written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4]
              Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes,
               hence nicknamed Blaugrana.
